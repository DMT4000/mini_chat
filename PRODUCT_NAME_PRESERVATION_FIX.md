# Fuxion Product Name Preservation Fix

## Problem Identified
The system was losing Fuxion product names during document retrieval and processing due to:
1. **Document truncation**: Documents were being cut off at 2200 characters per document and 12000 total characters
2. **Arbitrary truncation**: Truncation was happening mid-product entry, cutting off product names and details
3. **Insufficient context**: Product queries weren't getting enough context to preserve complete product information

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Document Retrieval Limits
- **Increased limits for product queries**: 
  - Per-document limit: 2200 → 3000 characters
  - Total limit: 12000 → 18000 characters
- **Smart detection**: Automatically detects product-related queries and applies higher limits

### 2. Intelligent Document Truncation
- **Smart truncation for Fuxion Products**: 
  - Truncates at product boundaries rather than arbitrary character limits
  - Preserves complete product entries (name, SKU, description, benefits)
  - Falls back to standard truncation only when necessary

### 3. Enhanced Product Recommendation Prompt
- **Critical instructions added**:
  - ALWAYS use EXACT product names as written in catalog
  - NEVER abbreviate, modify, or paraphrase product names
  - Always include exact SKU numbers and key phrases
  - Preserve exact formatting (e.g., "CAFÉ & CAFÉ FIT")

### 4. Post-Processing Validation
- **Response validation**: Automatically corrects common product name variations
- **Formatting correction**: Ensures product names have proper **bold** formatting
- **SKU verification**: Validates that SKU numbers are included

### 5. Product Name Correction Mapping
Common corrections implemented:
- 'alpha balance' → 'ALPHA BALANCE'
- 'beauty-in' → 'BEAUTY-IN'
- 'biopro' → 'BIOPRO+'
- 'café' → 'CAFÉ & CAFÉ FIT'
- 'chocolate fit' → 'CHOCOLATE FIT'
- And many more...

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`src/agent/workflow_nodes.py`**:
   - Added smart truncation logic
   - Increased document limits for product queries
   - Added post-processing validation

2. **`src/prompts/product_recommendation.yaml`**:
   - Enhanced with critical product name preservation instructions
   - Added explicit formatting requirements

### Key Functions Added
- `_smart_truncate_fuxion_products()`: Intelligent truncation at product boundaries
- `_validate_product_names_in_response()`: Post-processing validation and correction

## Results
✅ **Product names preserved**: All Fuxion product names are now preserved exactly as written
✅ **SKU numbers included**: All responses include correct SKU numbers
✅ **Complete information**: Full product details (name, SKU, key phrase, benefits) are preserved
✅ **Proper formatting**: Product names maintain proper **bold** formatting
✅ **Context preservation**: Product queries get sufficient context to provide complete information

## Testing
The fix has been tested with various product queries:
- "Tell me about ALPHA BALANCE" → ✅ Preserves "ALPHA BALANCE" with SKU 145879
- "What is BEAUTY-IN?" → ✅ Preserves "BEAUTY-IN" with SKU 143065
- "Give me information about BERRY BALANCE" → ✅ Preserves "BERRY BALANCE" with SKU 146065
- "Tell me about BIOPRO+ SPORT" → ✅ Preserves "BIOPRO+ SPORT" with SKU 143288
- "What products do you have for weight loss?" → ✅ Preserves multiple product names and SKUs

## Future Improvements
- Add more product name variations to the correction mapping
- Implement confidence scoring for product name matches
- Add validation for product descriptions and benefits
- Consider implementing fuzzy matching for product names
