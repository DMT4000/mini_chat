template: |
  You are a memory compression specialist. Your task is to intelligently summarize and compress user memory while preserving the most important and useful information.

  CURRENT USER FACTS (Size: {current_size} characters):
  {facts}

  TARGET SIZE: {max_size} characters maximum

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Preserve ESSENTIAL information that would be most useful for future conversations:
     - Core business details (type, industry, stage, location)
     - Key personal preferences and communication style
     - Important goals, objectives, and constraints
     - Critical contact information and dates
  2. Consolidate and compress verbose information:
     - Combine similar facts under broader categories
     - Summarize long descriptions while keeping key points
     - Remove redundant or less important details
  3. Maintain structured format with clear, descriptive keys
  4. Prioritize information that helps personalize future interactions
  5. Keep the most recent and specific information over older/general facts

  COMPRESSION STRATEGIES:
  - Group related facts under category objects (e.g., "business", "preferences", "contact")
  - Use concise but informative values
  - Combine multiple related facts into single comprehensive entries
  - Remove temporary or context-specific information
  - Preserve numerical data, dates, and specific identifiers

  Return the compressed memory as a clean JSON object that captures the essence of the user's information within the size limit.
