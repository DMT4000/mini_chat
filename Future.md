Here is a complete, multi-phase plan to evolve your mini_chat project into the "AI Co-founder" prototype you've envisioned. We will do this entirely on your local machine, introducing new technologies like Redis and LangGraph in a structured way.
Executive Summary
This plan will transform your mini_chat application from a stateless Q&A bot into a personalized, stateful AI assistant. It is broken into three distinct, sequential phases that will be implemented locally.
Phase 1: Foundation - Persistent Memory. We will integrate Redis (running locally via Docker) to give the AI a "brain." It will remember key user details (like business_type and state) across conversations, immediately delivering on your core principle of a non-repetitive user experience.
Phase 2: Velocity & Safety - The Eval Harness. We will build an automated testing framework. This "Eval Harness" will run a set of predefined questions against our AI and score its performance. This is the technical foundation for your "Two-Way Door" culture, allowing us to experiment and improve prompts or models with confidence.
Phase 3: Intelligence - Agentic Fact Extraction. We will evolve the system from a simple script into a true AI agent using LangGraph. This agent will not only answer questions but will also be able to analyze a conversation, identify new key facts about the user, and save them to its memory automatically, creating the feedback loop for your data moat.
By the end of this plan, you will have a local prototype that demonstrates all three of your core beliefs: advanced Context Engineering, Persistent Memory, and the foundation for Multi-Agent systems.
The Full Plan: From mini_chat to Local "AI Co-founder"
Phase 1: Foundation - Persistent Memory & Context
Goal: Implement Milestone #2. Make the AI remember a user across sessions.
Why: This is the most critical missing feature. It provides immediate, tangible value to the user and is the bedrock for all future personalization.
Step 1.1: Set Up the Local Environment
Action: Create a docker-compose.yml file in your project root. This will manage our Redis service locally.
Generated yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  redis:
    image: "redis/redis-stack-server:latest" # This image includes RedisJSON for future use
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
volumes:
  redis_data:
Use code with caution.
Yaml
Action: Create a requirements.txt file and add the necessary libraries.
Generated text
# requirements.txt
langchain
langchain-openai
fastapi
uvicorn
faiss-cpu
python-dotenv
redis
# Add langgraph later in Phase 3
Use code with caution.
Text
To Run: In your terminal, run docker-compose up -d. This starts Redis in the background.
Step 1.2: Build the Memory Module
Action: Create a new directory src/memory with a file redis_memory_manager.py. This encapsulates all Redis logic.
Generated python
# src/memory/redis_memory_manager.py
import redis
import json

class RedisMemoryManager:
    def __init__(self, host='localhost', port=6379):
        self.client = redis.Redis(host=host, port=port, db=0, decode_responses=True)

    def get_user_memory(self, user_id: str) -> dict:
        """Retrieves long-term memory for a user."""
        key = f"user:{user_id}:long_term"
        raw_data = self.client.get(key)
        return json.loads(raw_data) if raw_data else {}

    def save_user_memory(self, user_id: str, facts: dict):
        """Saves/overwrites the long-term memory for a user."""
        key = f"user:{user_id}:long_term"
        self.client.set(key, json.dumps(facts))
        print(f"Memory saved for user {user_id}.")
Use code with caution.
Python
Step 1.3: Update the API and Chat Logic to Use Memory
Action: Modify src/api.py to handle a user_id. For local testing, we'll pass it as a simple query parameter.
Action: Modify src/chat.py to perform Context Engineering: inject the user's memory into the prompt.
Generated python
# src/chat.py (Conceptual rewrite)
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
# ... other imports ...
from .prompt_registry import PromptRegistry
from .memory.redis_memory_manager import RedisMemoryManager

class ChatPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        # Same as before: load vector store, llm, etc.
        self.retriever = ... 
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
        self.prompt_registry = PromptRegistry()
        self.memory_manager = RedisMemoryManager()

    def ask(self, question: str, user_id: str):
        # 1. RETRIEVE long-term user memory
        user_facts = self.memory_manager.get_user_memory(user_id)
        
        # 2. RETRIEVE relevant documents from FAISS
        retrieved_docs = self.retriever.get_relevant_documents(question)
        
        # 3. ENGINEER the context
        facts_str = json.dumps(user_facts, indent=2) if user_facts else "No background information known."
        context_str = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in retrieved_docs])
        
        # 4. CREATE the prompt using the richer context
        prompt_template = self.prompt_registry.get_prompt("qa_with_memory") # A new prompt template
        prompt = prompt_template.format(
            user_facts=facts_str,
            context=context_str,
            question=question
        )
        
        # 5. GENERATE the answer
        response = self.llm.invoke(prompt)
        return {"answer": response.content, "user_facts_used": user_facts}
Use code with caution.
Python
Action: Create the new prompt template in prompts/qa.yaml. This explicitly tells the LLM how to use the user's background.
Phase 2: Velocity & Safety - The Eval Harness
Goal: Implement Milestone #4. Build an automated way to test our AI's quality.
Why: This allows us to make changes (e.g., try a new prompt, use a different model) and instantly see if we've caused a regression. It enables speed.
Step 2.1: Create Evaluation Test Cases
Action: Create a new directory evals/ and a file inside called eval_cases.yml.
Generated yaml
# evals/eval_cases.yml
- id: "CA_LLC_FORMATION"
  question: "I want to start an LLC in California. What's the main form I need to file?"
  user_facts:
    state: "California"
    business_type: "LLC"
  expected_keywords: ["Articles of Organization", "LLC-1"]

- id: "GENERIC_EIN"
  question: "How do I get an EIN for my business?"
  user_facts: {}
  expected_keywords: ["IRS", "SS-4"]
Use code with caution.
Yaml
Step 2.2: Build the Evaluation Script
Action: Create a new file in the root directory named run_evals.py.
Generated python
# run_evals.py
import yaml
from src.chat import ChatPipeline
from src.memory.redis_memory_manager import RedisMemoryManager

def run_evaluation():
    chat_pipeline = ChatPipeline()
    memory_manager = RedisMemoryManager()
    
    with open("evals/eval_cases.yml", "r") as f:
        test_cases = yaml.safe_load(f)
        
    print("--- Running AI Evaluations ---")
    passed_count = 0
    
    for case in test_cases:
        user_id = f"eval-{case['id']}"
        
        # Setup: Prime the AI's memory for this test case
        memory_manager.save_user_memory(user_id, case['user_facts'])
        
        # Execute: Get the AI's answer
        response = chat_pipeline.ask(case['question'], user_id)
        actual_answer = response['answer']
        
        # Assert: Check if the answer is correct
        score = all(kw.lower() in actual_answer.lower() for kw in case['expected_keywords'])
        
        if score:
            passed_count += 1
            print(f"[PASS] Test '{case['id']}'")
        else:
            print(f"[FAIL] Test '{case['id']}'")
            print(f"  -> Expected keywords not found: {case['expected_keywords']}")
            print(f"  -> Got: {actual_answer[:100]}...")

    print("\n--- Evaluation Summary ---")
    print(f"{passed_count} / {len(test_cases)} tests passed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_evaluation()
Use code with caution.
Python
Phase 3: Intelligence - Agentic Fact Extraction
Goal: Evolve from a simple script to a stateful agent that can learn.
Why: This is the first step toward your "AI Agent for Businesses" vision. The AI will not just use memory but will actively help build it, creating a primitive "data moat" by improving its own dataset through conversation. We will use langgraph for this, as you suggested.
Step 3.1: Install LangGraph
Action: Add langgraph to your requirements.txt and pip install -r requirements.txt.
Step 3.2: Design the Agent Graph
Action: We will redesign chat.py to use LangGraph. The graph will have nodes that represent steps in a thought process:
retrieve_context: Gets user memory and FAISS docs (what we have now).
generate_answer: Creates the answer for the user.
extract_facts: A new, separate LLM call to analyze the conversation and extract key-value pairs (e.g., {"industry": "coffee shop"}).
save_facts: Saves the newly extracted facts to Redis.
Action: Create src/agent.py to define this new logic.
Generated python
# src/agent.py (Conceptual - highlights the graph structure)
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, List

# 1. Define the agent's state
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    user_id: str
    question: str
    user_facts: dict
    retrieved_docs: List[str]
    answer: str
    newly_extracted_facts: dict

# 2. Define the nodes (functions that do the work)
def retrieve_context(state): # gets memory and docs
    #...
    return {"user_facts": ..., "retrieved_docs": ...}

def generate_answer(state): # generates the answer
    #...
    return {"answer": ...}

def extract_facts(state): # analyzes conversation to find new facts
    #... uses a special prompt to pull out key info
    return {"newly_extracted_facts": ...}

def save_facts(state): # saves new facts to Redis
    #...
    return {}

# 3. Build the graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("retrieve_context", retrieve_context)
workflow.add_node("generate_answer", generate_answer)
workflow.add_node("extract_facts", extract_facts)
workflow.add_node("save_facts", save_facts)

workflow.set_entry_point("retrieve_context")
workflow.add_edge("retrieve_context", "generate_answer")
workflow.add_edge("generate_answer", "extract_facts")
workflow.add_edge("extract_facts", "save_facts")
workflow.add_edge("save_facts", END)

app = workflow.compile() # This 'app' is our new runnable agent
Use code with caution.
Python
Step 3.3: How to Run the Final System
api.py will now import and run the compiled LangGraph app from agent.py instead of the old ChatPipeline. The result is a much more powerful and modular system that not only talks but also learns from each interaction, right on your local machine.
This completes the initial roadmap. You will have a robust, testable, and intelligent local prototype ready for the next stage of development, like tackling the "AI as the Front Door" and multi-agent patterns.
