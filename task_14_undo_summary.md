# Task 14 Undo Summary

## Overview
All components of Task 14 "Implement user-managed memory system" have been successfully undone and reverted to their pre-implementation state.

## Files Deleted
- ✅ `src/agent/memory_command_processor.py` - Memory command processor implementation
- ✅ `src/agent/memory_workflow_nodes.py` - Memory workflow nodes implementation
- ✅ `test_memory_workflow_nodes.py` - Test suite for memory workflow nodes
- ✅ `test_memory_nodes_simple.py` - Simple test file for memory nodes
- ✅ `test_memory_command_processor.py` - Test file for memory command processor
- ✅ `test_workflow_memory_commands.py` - Test file for workflow memory commands

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/agent/workflow.py` - Removed memory command processor imports and usage
  - Removed `from .memory_command_processor import MemoryCommandProcessor`
  - Removed `self.memory_command_processor = MemoryCommandProcessor()` initialization
  - Replaced `_memory_command_node()` implementation with placeholder error message

## Task Status Updates
- ✅ Task 14.1 "Create memory management commands" - Set to `not_started`
- ✅ Task 14.2 "Build memory management workflow nodes" - Set to `not_started`  
- ✅ Task 14.3 "Add memory management API endpoints" - Set to `not_started`

## Verification
- ✅ All imports removed successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors in remaining code
- ✅ Workflow.py compiles correctly with placeholder memory command node
- ✅ No orphaned references to deleted components

## Current State
The system is now in the same state as before Task 14 implementation:
- Memory command processing returns an error message indicating the feature is not implemented
- No memory management workflow nodes exist
- No memory management API endpoints exist
- All Task 14 components have been cleanly removed

## Files Preserved
The following specification files were preserved as they contain the design requirements:
- `.kiro/specs/ai-cofounder-evolution/tasks.md` - Task definitions (updated status only)
- `.kiro/specs/ai-cofounder-evolution/design.md` - Design specifications
- `.kiro/specs/ai-cofounder-evolution/requirements.md` - Requirements specifications

## External Test Files
The following external test files remain (outside main project structure):
- `memory_workflow_nodes_standalone.py` - Standalone test implementation (harmless)

## Next Steps
Task 14 can now be re-implemented from scratch if needed, with all previous implementation completely removed and no conflicts remaining.
