This is a second document for testing the mini_chat system.

Project Information:
- The mini_chat application uses LangChain and FAISS
- It has a web interface at localhost:8000
- Documents are stored in the docs/ folder
- The ingest script builds a vector index for searching
- The chat API allows asking questions about the documents

This demonstrates how you can have multiple documents and the AI will search across all of them when answering questions.
