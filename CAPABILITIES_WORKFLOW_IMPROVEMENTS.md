# Capabilities Workflow Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to ensure the AI Co-founder agent works perfectly with all document types and provides intelligent, accurate responses to capabilities questions.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Capabilities Question Routing Issue**
**Problem**: When users asked "what are your capabilities?", the workflow was incorrectly routing to the lightweight path instead of the full workflow that can access documents.

**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive capabilities question detection patterns in `workflow_router.py`
- Updated workflow routing logic to force capabilities questions through the full workflow
- Added `_is_capabilities_question()` method to detect various forms of capability inquiries

### 2. **Document Retrieval and Context Engineering**
**Problem**: The context engineering was not providing intelligent summaries of different document types, making responses less informative.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `_engineer_context()` function with intelligent document categorization
- Added specialized summary functions for different document types:
  - `_create_wellness_summary()` - Extracts workstreams and objectives
  - `_create_cronograma_summary()` - Extracts phases and milestones  
  - `_create_product_summary()` - Extracts product categories and names
  - `_create_other_docs_summary()` - Analyzes business themes
- Improved document retrieval query building for capabilities questions

### 3. **Prompt Template Enhancements**
**Problem**: The existing prompts didn't provide specific guidance for handling capabilities questions.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `qa_with_memory.yaml` with special handling instructions for capabilities questions
- Created new specialized `capabilities.yaml` prompt template with comprehensive instructions
- Updated workflow nodes to use the appropriate prompt based on question type

### 4. **Workflow Routing Logic**
**Problem**: The routing logic needed improvement to better detect when full document access was needed.

**Solution**:
- Added `_is_capabilities_question()` method to `AgentWorkflow` class
- Enhanced routing decision logic to prioritize capabilities questions
- Added comprehensive pattern matching for various capability question formats

### 5. **Document Retrieval Optimization**
**Problem**: Capabilities questions needed comprehensive document coverage to provide accurate responses.

**Solution**:
- Increased document limits for capabilities questions (12 docs, 35K chars total, 4K per doc)
- Enhanced document scoring to prioritize diverse document types for capabilities questions
- Improved retrieval query building with comprehensive keywords for capabilities questions

## Key Improvements Made

### A. Enhanced Capabilities Detection
```python
# Added comprehensive patterns for detecting capabilities questions
capabilities_patterns = [
    r'\b(what are|what is|tell me about|explain) (your|the) (capabilities|abilities|features|functions|skills)\b',
    r'\b(what can|what do) you (do|help with|assist with|support)\b',
    r'\b(how do|how can) you (help|assist|support|work)\b',
    # ... and many more patterns
]
```

### B. Intelligent Document Summaries
```python
def _create_wellness_summary(docs: List[str]) -> str:
    """Create intelligent summary of wellness app development documents."""
    # Extracts workstreams, objectives, and provides structured overview
    
def _create_cronograma_summary(docs: List[str]) -> str:
    """Create intelligent summary of project timeline documents."""
    # Extracts phases, milestones, and provides structured overview
```

### C. Specialized Capabilities Prompt
Created `capabilities.yaml` with comprehensive instructions for:
- Professional introduction
- Core capabilities overview
- Document access details
- Specific examples of assistance
- Personalization emphasis
- Call to action

### D. Enhanced Workflow Routing
```python
def _is_capabilities_question(self, state: AgentState) -> bool:
    """Check if question is asking about agent capabilities."""
    # Comprehensive detection with pattern matching and keyword analysis
```

## Files Modified

1. **`mini_chat/src/agent/workflow_router.py`**
   - Added capabilities question patterns to `DOC_QUESTION_PATTERNS`

2. **`mini_chat/src/agent/workflow.py`**
   - Added `_is_capabilities_question()` method
   - Enhanced routing logic for capabilities questions

3. **`mini_chat/src/agent/workflow_nodes.py`**
   - Enhanced `_engineer_context()` with intelligent summaries
   - Added specialized summary functions
   - Improved capabilities question detection
   - Enhanced document retrieval for capabilities questions
   - Added specialized prompt selection

4. **`mini_chat/src/prompts/qa_with_memory.yaml`**
   - Added special handling instructions for capabilities questions

5. **`mini_chat/src/prompts/capabilities.yaml`**
   - New specialized prompt template for capabilities questions

6. **`mini_chat/test_capabilities_workflow.py`**
   - New test script to verify capabilities workflow functionality

## Expected Results

With these improvements, the agent should now:

✅ **Correctly route capabilities questions** through the full workflow instead of lightweight responses

✅ **Provide comprehensive capabilities overviews** with specific examples from available documents

✅ **Access and analyze all document types** including:
- Wellness app development plans
- Project timelines (cronogramas)
- Fuxion product catalogs
- Business formation documents

✅ **Give intelligent, personalized responses** that reference actual document content

✅ **Maintain conversation context** and provide follow-up guidance

## Testing

Run the test script to verify improvements:
```bash
cd mini_chat
python test_capabilities_workflow.py
```

This will test:
- Capabilities question detection
- Full workflow execution
- Response quality and completeness
- Document access and analysis

## Usage Examples

Users can now ask various forms of capabilities questions and receive comprehensive responses:

- "What are your capabilities?"
- "What can you do?"
- "What documents do you have access to?"
- "How do you help with business planning?"
- "What Fuxion products can you recommend?"
- "Can you analyze my wellness app plan?"

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **Capabilities dashboard** - Visual overview of agent capabilities
2. **Document type filtering** - Allow users to focus on specific document types
3. **Capability examples** - Interactive demonstrations of agent functionality
4. **Performance metrics** - Track capabilities question success rates

## Conclusion

These improvements ensure that the AI Co-founder agent is now:
- **Intelligent** - Provides comprehensive, accurate responses
- **Well-informed** - Accesses and analyzes all available documents
- **Helpful** - Gives specific, actionable guidance
- **Professional** - Maintains consistent, high-quality interactions

The agent should now work perfectly with all different document types and provide intelligent responses to capabilities questions, demonstrating its full potential as a business assistant.
