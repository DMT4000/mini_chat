# Memory Management and Workflow Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to fix memory management and workflow routing issues in the chat system. The system now properly considers all documents and matches accordingly, ensuring the workflow works correctly for complex queries.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Document Question Detection
**Problem**: The original `is_document_question` function only detected very specific patterns and missed many legitimate document-related queries.

**Solution**: Expanded document question detection patterns to include:
- Wellness app related keywords (wellness, app, workstream, ws, plan de trabajo)
- Cronograma/timeline related keywords (cronograma, timeline, schedule, gate, phase)
- General document content patterns (tell me about, what is, show me)
- Spanish language patterns (cu√°l es, qu√© es, mu√©strame)

**Files Modified**: `src/agent/workflow_router.py`

### 2. Workflow Routing Logic
**Problem**: The routing logic was too restrictive and bypassed important document retrieval for certain types of questions.

**Solution**: Enhanced routing logic to ensure:
- Wellness app and cronograma related questions always go through full workflow
- Document-related questions are properly routed for context retrieval
- Product recommendations maintain access to Fuxion products
- Identity/profile questions go through context retrieval for memory management

**Files Modified**: `src/agent/workflow.py`

### 3. Document Retrieval and Context Integration
**Problem**: The system didn't properly integrate user memory with document retrieval, leading to incomplete context.

**Solution**: Improved context retrieval to:
- Build comprehensive retrieval queries that include user memory
- Apply enhanced re-ranking that considers user facts and document relevance
- Increase document limits for complex queries (wellness app, cronograma)
- Group documents by type for better context organization

**Files Modified**: `src/agent/workflow_nodes.py`

### 4. Context Engineering
**Problem**: The context engineering function didn't properly structure and prioritize information.

**Solution**: Enhanced context engineering to:
- Separate priority facts (identity, preferences) from regular facts
- Group documents by type (wellness, cronograma, products, other)
- Provide structured document context with clear sections
- Include conversation history for better continuity

**Files Modified**: `src/agent/workflow_nodes.py`

### 5. Fact Extraction and Processing
**Problem**: Fact extraction didn't handle domain-specific information well.

**Solution**: Improved fact extraction to:
- Use specialized prompts for wellness app and cronograma domains
- Post-process extracted facts for consistency
- Normalize workstream, phase, and milestone information
- Maintain fact relationships and structure

**Files Modified**: `src/agent/workflow_nodes.py`

### 6. Variable Scope Issues
**Problem**: There were variable scope issues in the document retrieval code that caused errors.

**Solution**: Fixed variable naming conflicts by:
- Using different variable names for inner and outer loops
- Properly passing document objects to scoring functions
- Ensuring consistent variable usage throughout the code

**Files Modified**: `src/agent/workflow_nodes.py`

## Key Improvements Made

### Enhanced Document Detection
```python
# Wellness app related patterns
r"\b(wellness|wellness app|wellness application)\b",
r"\b(plan de trabajo|work plan|development plan)\b",
r"\b(workstream|work stream|ws\d*)\b",

# Cronograma/timeline related patterns  
r"\b(cronograma|timeline|schedule|calendar)\b",
r"\b(project timeline|project schedule)\b",
r"\b(gate|gateway|checkpoint)\b",
```

### Improved Workflow Routing
```python
# Force wellness app and cronograma related questions through full workflow
elif self._is_wellness_or_cronograma_question(state):
    print("üìã Routing to full workflow for wellness app/cronograma question")
    return "full_workflow"
```

### Enhanced Context Retrieval
```python
# Increase limits for complex document queries
elif any(keyword in state['question'].lower() for keyword in 
        ['cronograma', 'timeline', 'schedule', 'plan', 'workstream', 'ws', 'fase', 'gate', 'wellness', 'app']):
    MAX_TOTAL_CHARS = 30000  # Much higher total character limit for complex docs
    MAX_PER_DOC_CHARS = 6000  # Higher per-document limit to preserve context
```

### Better Context Engineering
```python
# Group documents by type for better organization
if wellness_docs:
    doc_sections.append("WELLNESS APP DEVELOPMENT PLAN:\n" + "\n\n".join(wellness_docs[:3]))
if cronograma_docs:
    doc_sections.append("PROJECT TIMELINE (CRONOGRAMA):\n" + "\n\n".join(cronograma_docs[:3]))
```

## Testing Results

The improvements have been tested and verified:

‚úÖ **Document Question Detection**: Successfully detects wellness app and cronograma related questions
‚úÖ **Workflow Routing**: Properly routes complex questions through the full workflow
‚úÖ **Document Retrieval**: Successfully retrieves relevant documents (4 documents in test)
‚úÖ **Memory Integration**: User facts are properly integrated with document context
‚úÖ **Context Engineering**: Documents are properly categorized and structured
‚úÖ **Answer Generation**: Comprehensive answers are generated based on retrieved context

## Example Test Results

```
üîç Question: 'Tell me about the wellness app plan and what workstreams are involved'
üìö Document question detected: True
üéØ Question complexity: complex
üé≠ Intent: product_recommendation

‚úÖ Retrieved 4 relevant documents (budgeted 2293 chars)
üìö Document sources retrieved:
  1. docs\Plan de trabajo completo Wellness APP - 15-08-25.pdf
  2. docs\Plan de trabajo completo Wellness APP - 15-08-25.pdf
  3. docs\Plan de trabajo completo Wellness APP - 15-08-25.pdf
  4. docs\sample.txt

üß† Context engineering: 0 priority facts, 1 regular facts
üìö Context engineering: 3 wellness docs, 0 cronograma docs, 0 product docs, 1 other docs
```
