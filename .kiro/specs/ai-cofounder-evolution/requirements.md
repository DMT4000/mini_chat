# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of the existing mini_chat application into an "AI Co-founder" prototype. The evolution will be implemented in three sequential phases, introducing persistent memory, automated evaluation, and agentic fact extraction capabilities. The system will demonstrate advanced Context Engineering, Persistent Memory, and Multi-Agent foundations while running entirely on the local machine.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Persistent Memory Foundation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to remember key details about me across conversations, so that I don't have to repeat information and get increasingly personalized responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL retrieve their stored memory from Redis
2. WHEN a user provides personal information THEN the system SHALL store it persistently for future sessions
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL incorporate user-specific context from memory
4. IF no memory exists for a user THEN the system SHALL initialize empty memory gracefully
5. WHEN memory is updated THEN the system SHALL persist changes to Redis immediately

### Requirement 2: Local Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire system locally with Docker, so that I can develop and test without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the environment THEN the system SHALL provide a docker-compose.yml for Redis
2. WHEN Redis starts THEN it SHALL be accessible on localhost:6379
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to Redis successfully
4. IF Redis is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN data is stored THEN it SHALL persist across Redis container restarts

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Context Engineering

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to use both my personal context and relevant documents when answering questions, so that responses are both personalized and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve user memory and relevant documents
2. WHEN constructing prompts THEN the system SHALL combine user facts with document context
3. WHEN user facts exist THEN they SHALL be formatted clearly in the prompt
4. WHEN no user facts exist THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the prompt
5. WHEN generating responses THEN the AI SHALL reference both personal context and documents appropriately

### Requirement 4: Automated Evaluation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically test the AI's performance with predefined test cases, so that I can confidently make improvements without causing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running evaluations THEN the system SHALL load test cases from YAML configuration
2. WHEN executing test cases THEN the system SHALL set up user memory as specified
3. WHEN evaluating responses THEN the system SHALL check for expected keywords
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of pass/fail results
5. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL show expected vs actual content

### Requirement 5: Test Case Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define evaluation test cases in a structured format, so that I can easily add new tests and maintain existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining test cases THEN they SHALL be stored in YAML format
2. WHEN creating test cases THEN they SHALL include question, user facts, and expected keywords
3. WHEN test cases are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate the format
4. WHEN adding new test cases THEN they SHALL follow the established schema
5. WHEN test cases reference user facts THEN they SHALL be properly injected into memory

### Requirement 6: Agentic Fact Extraction

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to automatically learn and remember new facts about me from our conversations, so that it becomes increasingly helpful over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation occurs THEN the system SHALL analyze it for extractable facts
2. WHEN new facts are identified THEN they SHALL be saved to user memory
3. WHEN extracting facts THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated LLM prompt
4. WHEN facts are extracted THEN they SHALL be in structured key-value format
5. WHEN saving facts THEN existing memory SHALL be updated, not replaced

### Requirement 7: LangGraph Agent Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use LangGraph for stateful agent workflows, so that the AI can perform complex multi-step reasoning and learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL use a LangGraph state machine
2. WHEN defining the workflow THEN it SHALL include retrieve, generate, extract, and save nodes
3. WHEN executing the workflow THEN state SHALL be passed between nodes correctly
4. WHEN the workflow completes THEN all steps SHALL have executed successfully
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the workflow SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 8: Memory Management API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean interface for managing user memory, so that I can easily store, retrieve, and update user information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing memory THEN the system SHALL provide get_user_memory method
2. WHEN saving memory THEN the system SHALL provide save_user_memory method
3. WHEN memory operations occur THEN they SHALL handle JSON serialization automatically
4. WHEN Redis operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
5. WHEN user IDs are provided THEN they SHALL be properly namespaced in Redis

### Requirement 9: Enhanced Prompt Templates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want prompt templates that can handle both user context and document retrieval, so that the AI generates contextually rich responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating prompts THEN they SHALL support user facts injection
2. WHEN user facts are available THEN they SHALL be formatted clearly in prompts
3. WHEN document context is available THEN it SHALL be included in prompts
4. WHEN prompts are generated THEN they SHALL maintain consistent formatting
5. WHEN prompt templates are updated THEN they SHALL be backward compatible

### Requirement 10: User Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be identified consistently across sessions, so that my memory persists correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN users SHALL be identified by user_id parameter
2. WHEN user_id is provided THEN it SHALL be used for memory operations
3. WHEN user_id is missing THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message
4. WHEN multiple users interact THEN their memories SHALL remain separate
5. WHEN sessions end THEN user memory SHALL persist for future sessions

### Requirement 11: Intelligent Workflow Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to respond efficiently to different types of interactions, so that simple greetings don't take as long as complex business questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a simple greeting THEN the system SHALL use a lightweight response path
2. WHEN a user asks a complex question THEN the system SHALL use the full retrieval and analysis workflow
3. WHEN classifying interactions THEN the system SHALL distinguish between conversational and substantive queries

5. WHEN efficiency is improved THEN response times SHALL be measurably faster for simple interactions

### Requirement 12: Advanced Fact Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to intelligently manage my stored information, avoiding duplicates and resolving conflicts, so that my memory remains clean and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar facts are extracted THEN the system SHALL consolidate them using LLM reasoning
2. WHEN conflicting facts are found THEN the system SHALL resolve them intelligently
3. WHEN facts have low confidence THEN they SHALL be filtered out before saving
4. WHEN facts are merged THEN the system SHALL preserve important details
5. WHEN memory becomes large THEN the system SHALL summarize and optimize storage

### Requirement 13: User-Controlled Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view, edit, and delete my stored information, so that I have control over what the AI remembers about me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "!memory" THEN the system SHALL show all my stored facts
2. WHEN I type "!forget [topic]" THEN the system SHALL remove specific information
3. WHEN I type "!update [fact]" THEN the system SHALL modify existing information
4. WHEN I manage my memory THEN changes SHALL be reflected immediately
5. WHEN I export my data THEN the system SHALL provide it in a readable format

### Requirement 14: Advanced Context Retrieval
